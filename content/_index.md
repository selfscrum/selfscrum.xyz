## Why?

* Web3 unlocks a big potential for networked, independent organizations.
* With education, we have a big domain in urgent need of reform.
* The knowledge chasm between those two domains is incredible deep.
* This initiative aims to connect both worlds with a learning experience.
* Stay tuned :)
