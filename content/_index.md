{{< slide id="Why"  transition="fade" transition-speed="fast" >}}

## Why?

* Within education, we have an urgent need towards self-directed learning.
* We see that the current education system is unable to reform itself.
* Web3 unlocks a big potential for new, networked, independent organizations.
* The knowledge chasm between those two domains is incredible deep.
* This initiative aims to connect both worlds with a learning experience.
